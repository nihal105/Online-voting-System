# Online-voting-System

The Online Voting System is a menu-driven console application developed using Core Python.
The purpose of this project is to simulate a basic electronic voting process where registered voters can log in using a unique voter ID and cast their vote securely.

The system maintains predefined lists of voters and candidates using Python dictionaries. Each voter is allowed to vote only once, ensuring fairness and preventing duplicate voting. The application provides options to display candidates, cast votes, view voting results, and check the total number of votes cast.

This project focuses on demonstrating fundamental Python programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, dictionary operations, and input validation. It is ideal for beginners who want hands-on experience with real-world logic using simple Python code.

Conclution

The Online Voting System successfully demonstrates how a simple and secure voting mechanism can be implemented using Core Python. By enforcing voter authentication and preventing multiple votes from the same user, the system ensures transparency and reliability within its limited scope.

This project serves as a strong foundation for understanding menu-driven programs and real-life problem-solving using Python. While the current implementation is suitable for educational purposes, it can be further enhanced by adding features such as persistent data storage, graphical user interface (GUI), and advanced authentication mechanisms.

Overall, this project helps learners strengthen their Python fundamentals and provides a clear understanding of how basic software systems are designed and executed.
