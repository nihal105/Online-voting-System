# Online-voting-System

## Online Voting System (Core Python)

A menu-driven Online Voting System developed using Core Python only.
This project demonstrates fundamental Python concepts such as dictionaries, functions, loops, and conditional statements while simulating a simple voting process.

## Project Overview

The Online Voting System allows predefined voters to securely log in using their voter ID, view available candidates, cast a single vote, and view voting results.
Duplicate voting is strictly prevented to maintain fairness.

This project is ideal for beginners and students learning Python fundamentals.

## Features

 • Voter login using Voter ID

 • Prevents duplicate voting

 • Displays candidate list

• Allows eligible voters to cast a vote

• Displays real-time voting results

• Shows total vote count summary

• Menu-driven console interface

• Technologies Used

## Language: Python

## Concepts:

• Dictionaries

• Functions

• Loops

• Conditional Statements

• Global Variables

• Console Input/Output

## How to Run the Program

Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system

Navigate to the project directory:

cd online-voting-system

Run the program:

python voting_system.py

## Predefined Voters
Voter ID	Voting Status

V101	Not Voted

V102	Not Voted

V103	Not Voted

V104	Not Voted

## Candidates

Candidate No	Candidate Name

1	Candidate A

2	Candidate B

3	Candidate C

## Menu Options

1. Login
 
2. Display Candidates
   
3. Cast Vote
  
4. Display Results

5. Vote Count Summary
   
6. Exit

## Rules & Constraints

• Each voter can vote only once

• Invalid voter IDs are rejected

• Voting without login is not allowed

• Data is stored temporarily (no database)

## Future Enhancements

• Add file or database storage

• Admin authentication

• Result winner declaration

• Graphical User Interface (GUI)

• Dynamic voter & candidate registration

## Learning Outcomes

• Understanding Python dictionaries and functions

• Implementing menu-driven programs

• Applying logical checks and validations

• Writing clean, structured Python code
